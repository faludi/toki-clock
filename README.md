This Toki Clock uses the traditional Japanese temporal hours system. Daytime between sunrise and sunset was divided into 6 toki. Nighttime from sunset until dawn was separately divided into 6 toki. At the spring and autumnal equinox, the length of day and night are the same. However summer has longer days and winter shorter ones, so the toki length differs seasonally, and also geograpically with latitude.

This system of naturally-sourced timekeeping required complicated mechanical clocks, however in the digital age, anyone can make their own Toki clock using the flexibility provided by software.
